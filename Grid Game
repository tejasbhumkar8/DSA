Grid Game
Input: grid = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.
The second robot will collect 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 4 points.
Solution -
class Solution {
    public long gridGame(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid[0].length;
        if (n < 2) return 0;

        long topSum = 0;
        for (int val : grid[0]) {
            topSum += val;
        }

        long bottomSum = 0;
        long minSum = Long.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int pp = 0; pp < n; ++pp) {
            topSum -= grid[0][pp];
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, Math.max(topSum, bottomSum));
            bottomSum += grid[1][pp];
        }

        return minSum;   
    }
}
