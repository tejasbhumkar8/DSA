Next Greater Element I

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Solution -

class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Deque<Integer> st = new ArrayDeque<>();
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> hmap = new HashMap<>();

        //iterating an nums2 array 
        for(int num: nums2)
        {
            //chking the num is greater than peek means we got greater no. need to pop and add in hmap
            while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek() < num) 
            {
                hmap.put(st.peek(),num);
                st.pop();
            }
            // if stack is empty or number is current number is smaller than peek add in stack
            st.push(num);
        }

        int n= nums1.length;
        int res [] = new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            // those number are added in hmap we get that number with res greater no. reamining are -1
            res[i]=hmap.getOrDefault(nums1[i],-1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
